#Ex 1: Grading Program
#You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. 
#The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
#Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
#By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. 
#The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
#DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
#DO NOT write any print statements.
#This is the scoring criteria:
#    Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
#    Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#    Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
#    Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
