#Ex 1 - Heads or Tails
#You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
#Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.
#When you run the code, just use a random number as the seed. e.g. 67346 It doesn't matter what you chose, it's only for our testing code to check your work.
#Remember to use the random module
#Hint: Remember to import the random module here at the top of the file. ðŸŽ²

#Ex2: Who's paying the bill? Randomized name picker
