#Exercise 1: Even or odd numbers
#Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
#Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")
    
#Exercise 2: BMI 2.0
#It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#Under 18.5 they are underweight
#Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
#Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
#Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
#Above 35 they are clinically obese.
#Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
#Remember to round your result to the nearest whole number.
#Make sure you include the words in bold from the interpretations.
bmi = round(weight / height ** 2)

#Exercise 3: Is a given year a leap year?
#Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
#This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
