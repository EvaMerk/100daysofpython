# Exercise 1:
# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
digit_1 = int(two_digit_number[0])
digit_2 = int(two_digit_number[1])
print(digit_1 + digit_2)

# Exercise 2:
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height = float(height)
weight = float(weight)
bmi = round(weight / (height * height), 2)
print(bmi)
